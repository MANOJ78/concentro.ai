Running Docker on AWS EC2

Step 1 — Setup EC2 instance
Go ahead and launch the instance and allows access to port 80(HTTP) from anywhere, and SSH access also.

Step 2 — Install Docker
Once your instance is ready to use, connect via SSH to the ser ver using the public DNS
and the public key:

Once connected, use yum con􀁢guration manager to install Docker, by typing the

following commands:
sudo yum update -y

sudo yum install -y docker

Next, start the docker service:

sudo service docker start

In order to user docker command without root privileges (sudo), we need to add ec2-
user to the docker group:

sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

To verify that docker is correctly installed, just type:

docker info

Then, you can see the latest version of docker has been installed (v17.03.1-ce)

Step 3 — Deploy Docker Container

It’s time to run your first container. 

We will create an nginx container with this command:

docker run  -d -p 80:80 --name ngnix ngnix

If we run the list command “docker ps”, we can see that an nginx container has been
created from the nginx o􀁪cial image.

Finally, you visit your instance public DNS name in your browser.
